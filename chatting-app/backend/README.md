# Realtime Chat App with MERN stack (Backend)

### Introduction
This repo consists of the **Backend** part of a Realtime Chat Application built with the MERN stack. I built it when I was trying to learn React and the stack for the first time.
You can find the frontend repo [here](https://github.com/pankajjaat2004/Project-X/chatting-app-client).

### Feature

- One-on-one **Private Chat** where users can chat with others privately.
- Create a room and start a **Room Chat** for users who want to broadcast messages to a specific group of users.
- Real-time updates to conversation messages, user online/ offline, read/ unread status, user join/leave room to notify, etc.
- Support both RWD and different themes with light and dark mode
